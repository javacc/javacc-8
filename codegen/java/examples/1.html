<br>In the last couple of days, we had seen a couple of users facing problems with
<br>regular expressions that match "". There is a minor bug in the way it is 
<br>implemented in 0.6.-9. We will fix it.
<br>
<br>But the purpose of this mail is to suggest you should be careful when you use
<br>RE's that match the "" string. Consider the following example of string literals
<br>where two consecutive "" are interpreted as the literal " (equivalent to \" in
<br>Java).
<br>
<br>&lt; STRING_LITERAL: ( "\"" (~["\""])* "\"" )* &gt;
<br>
<br>This will work in general. But, if this a part of a lot of other lexical rules,
<br>then if there a lexical error, say a char is given that cannot be the first one
<br>of any token, then, the lexer decides to use the empty string "" and match it
<br>as STRING_LITERAL without actually giving the lexical error. And since this is
<br>the empty string, no character will be consumed and you will start getting the
<br>same STRING_LITERAL token (with "" as the image) infinte number of times. In
<br>fact, if this was the only lexical rule, then if you give a input that starts
<br>with any char other than the ", you will get into an infinite loop.
<br>
<br>So a better alternative is to use the + operator which will not match the empty
<br>string. As a matter of fact, I don't know any practical grammar where matching
<br>"" is useful.
<br>
<br>In version 0.5, the lexer generated implicitly treated it as + (which is not
<br>totally right). But in 0.6.-9, it does it right and so there is a chance that
<br>your grammar that used to work with 0.5 will not work with 0.6.-9. So if you
<br>have any top-level lexical rule with ? or *, please change those rules so that
<br>they don't match the empty string "".
