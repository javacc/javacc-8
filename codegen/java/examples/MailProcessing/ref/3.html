Well, I finally got an HTML grammar out there (at
<br>http://www.tiac.net/users/kimbo/jack/HTML.jack).  I hope you saw it, I
<br>got some mailer errors, that seemed like the kind that you could ignore,
<br>but at least one person didn't receive my first posting.
<br>
<br>I'd be interested to know if this is the sort of thing people are
<br>looking for, or do they want the full set of tags enumerated in the
<br>grammar as well?  Also, if there you have any desire to bundle this with
<br>Jack (possibly after upgrades and/or integration with other people's
<br>work), please feel free.
<br>
<br>I must say Jack is an amazing tool.  It was really easy to learn.  I
<br>love how readable the grammars are, and I love being able to pass info
<br>up and down the productions as the parser runs.  I never want to have to
<br>settle for LALR(1) again!  Thanks for writing it!
